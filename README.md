# MEJIA-Python-Portfolio

Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository will include some of the code and projects that I will be working on during my **Elements of Computing II** class, as well as other projects that I work on as I pursue my degree in **Business Analytics** and **Computing**. My goal is to document and showcase my skills in Python through various coding challenges, data analysis tasks, and machine learning projects.

## Repository Structure
- **Computing II**: This folder contains the work I will be doing throughout the *Elements of Computing II* course.
    - **In-Class Assignments**: This subfolder includes assignments that I complete twice a week during class. [Link to In-Class Assignments](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Computing%20II/Class%20Assingments)
    - **basic-streamlit-app**: This folder includes projects that I have done both in class and projects that I am currently working on. Everything in this folder represents work I have done using **Streamlit**.
        - The [`main.py`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Computing%20II/basic-streamlit-app/main.py) script inside this folder contains a basic Streamlit app that I created to analyze customer shopping trends interactively. 
        - The [`README.md`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Computing%20II/basic-streamlit-app/README.md) inside the `basic-streamlit-app` folder provides guidance on how to operate the app.
