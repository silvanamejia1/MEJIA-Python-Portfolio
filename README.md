# MEJIA-Python-Portfolio

Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository will include some of the code and projects that I will be working on during my **Elements of Computing II** class, as well as other projects that I work on as I pursue my degree in **Business Analytics** and **Computing**. My goal is to document and showcase my skills in Python through various coding challenges, data analysis tasks, and machine learning projects.

## Repository Structure
- **Computing II**: This folder contains the work I will be doing throughout the *Elements of Computing II* course.
    - **Class Assignments**: This subfolder includes assignments that I complete twice a week during class. [Link to In-Class Assignments](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Computing%20II/Class%20Assingments)
    - **basic-streamlit-app**: This folder includes projects that I have done both in class and projects that I am currently working on. Everything in this folder represents work I have done using **Streamlit**.
        - The [`main.py`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Computing%20II/basic-streamlit-app/main.py) script inside this folder contains a basic Streamlit app that I created to analyze customer shopping trends interactively. 
        - The [`README.md`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Computing%20II/basic-streamlit-app/README.md) inside the `basic-streamlit-app` folder provides guidance on how to operate the app.
    - **TidyData_Project**: This folder includes a recent project that I worked on working with a sparse dataset and employing tidy data principles. This project compelents my oevrall coding protafolio as it demonstrates knowledge in jupyter knowbook and building data stories through visual tools. 
        - The [`tidy_code.ipynb`]  (link ) is a jupyter notebook containing the code used to tidy the data build visualizations and pivot tables that reveal insights about the data. 
        - The [`README.md`] (LINK ) indise the `TidyData_Project` folder provides instructions to operate the jupyter notebook, backround information on the dataset, main insights obatined and the refernece to resources employed to develop the project.
