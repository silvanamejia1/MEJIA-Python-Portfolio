# MEJIA-Python-Portfolio

Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository will include some of the code and projects that I will be working on during my **Elements of Computing II** class, as well as other projects that I work on as I pursue my degree in **Business Analytics** and **Computing**. My goal is to document and showcase my skills in Python through various coding challenges, data analysis tasks, and machine learning projects.

## Repository Structure
- **Computing II**: This folder contains the work I will be doing throughout the *Elements of Computing II* course.
    - **Class Assignments**: This subfolder includes assignments that I complete twice a week during class. [Link to In-Class Assignments](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Computing%20II/Class%20Assingments)

    - **Homework**: This folder contains additional assignments completed as part of the *Elements of Computing II* course. These homeworks reflect key concepts we've worked on in class and demonstrate my progression throughout the semester.
        - The [`Homework`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Computing_2/Homework) folder includes a variety of coding exercises specificaly using spaCy and Python. 
    
    - **basic-streamlit-app**: This folder includes projects that I have done both in class and projects that I am currently working on. Everything in this folder represents work I have done using **Streamlit**.
        - The [`main.py`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Computing%20II/basic-streamlit-app/main.py) script inside this folder contains a basic Streamlit app that I created to analyze customer shopping trends interactively. 
        - The [`README.md`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Computing%20II/basic-streamlit-app/README.md) inside the `basic-streamlit-app` folder provides guidance on how to operate the app.


    - **TidyData_Project**: This folder includes a recent project that I worked on working with a sparse dataset and employing tidy data principles to resturcture into a long format with no missing values. This project complements my overall coding protafolio as it demonstrates knowledge in jupyter notebooks, pandas, tidy data processing and building data stories through visual tools. 
        - The [`tidy_code.ipynb`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Computing%20II/TidyData_Project/tidy_code.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook containing the code used to tidy the data build visualizations and pivot tables that reveal insights about the data. 
        - The [`README.md`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Computing%20II/TidyData_Project/README.md) inside the `TidyData_Project` folder provides instructions to operate the jupyter notebook, backround information on the dataset, main insights obatined (with visuals) and the reference to resources employed to develop the project.

    - **NERStreamlitApp**: This folder contains a Named Entity Recognition (NER) web app built using **spaCy** and **Streamlit**. Users can paste or upload text, define custom entity patterns, and see their entities in addition to spaCy’s built-in ones highlighted using the DisplaCy visualizer. This project strengthens my portfolio by demonstrating my ability to integrate **natural language processing techniques** with user-friendly interface design, and clearly communicate how custom **EntityRuler** patters and pre-trained NER models can work together.
        - The [`NERStreamlitApp`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Computing_2/NERStreamlitApp) folder includes the full Streamlit app script and a detailed [`README.md`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Computing_2/NERStreamlitApp/README.md) with setup instructions, feature explanations, and sample text for testing.
    
    - **StreamlitAppFinal - EasyInvest App**: This folder contains an interactive financial planning app built using **Streamlit**. Inspired by my interest in finance and personal experience as a beginner investor, this app helps users easily understand how to allocate their income and build a personalized investment plan. Users can input key details like age, income, dependents, and risk tolerance to receive tailored recommendations, interactive visualizations, and beginner-friendly investment guidance. This project strengthens my portfolio by demonstrating how I can leverage **Python and Streamlit to design seamless and intuitive user experiences**. Through the app's interactive filters, clear visuals, and actionable investment suggestions, I show my ability to transform complex financial concepts into accessible tools. This tool seeks to respond to the lack of beginner-friendly financial planning apps and serves as a solution that adresses real user needs.
        - The [`StreamlitAppFinal`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Computing_2/StreamlitAppFinal) folder includes the full Streamlit app script and a detailed [`README.md`](https://github.com/silvanamejia1/MEJIA-Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Computing_2/StreamlitAppFinal/README.md) with setup instructions, feature explanations, and app usage examples.
