Welcome to **EasyInvest Planner**. Your personalized tool to help you better plan your income allocation and investment strategy. üéØ

This app takes into account your age, income, financial dependents, and risk preferences to give you two key recommendations:
- **How to allocate your income** ‚Üí Essentials, Savings, Investing, and Fun/Other.
- **How to invest your investment portion** ‚Üí Variable Income, Fixed Income, and Alternatives.

### üìå How do filters affect my plan?
- **Age** ‚Üí Younger users are recommended to take more investment risk (more variable income). Older users shift toward safer options (more Fixed Income).
- **Income** ‚Üí Higher income allows for higher saving and investing percentages.
- **Dependents** ‚Üí More dependents means safer allocations (less variable Income, more Fixed Income) and slightly higher essential expenses. This supposes taht a higher % of your income would go towards essential for otehr members in your family.
- **Risk Tolerance** ‚Üí If you prefer higher risk, your portfolio will lean more toward Variable. If lower, toward Fixed Income. Answer this based on personal preference.
- **Savings Goal** ‚Üí While not changing calculations directly, it helps frame your investment mindset.

Use the filters on the left to personalize your plan and click the buttons to see a clear visual breakdown of where your money should go and how you should invest.

with st.expander("What is Variable Income?"):
     st.markdown("""
Variable income investments are assets where returns can fluctuate depending on market performance. They tend to offer **higher growth potential but also more volatility.**

**How it impacts your portfolio:**  
Increases your potential for long-term growth, but adds more risk. Suitable when you're younger or willing to take more risk.

**Examples:**  
- Stocks  
- S&P 500 Index Funds  
- Mutual Funds
""")

# Explanation of Fixed Income
with st.expander("What is Fixed Income?"):
        st.markdown("""
Fixed income investments provide stable and predictable returns, making them **lower-risk options.** These investments help preserve your capital and offer steady income.

**How it impacts your portfolio:**  
Reduces risk and volatility, while ensuring you have consistent returns. Especially important as you get closer to retirement or have lower risk tolerance.

**Examples:**  
- Treasury Bonds  
- Certificates of Deposit (CDs)  
- Municipal Bonds
        """)

# Explanation of Alternatives
with st.expander("What are Alternatives?"):
    st.markdown("""
Alternatives include investments that are outside of traditional stocks and bonds. Despite being **risky**, they **help diversify your portfolio** and often behave differently in various market conditions.

**How it impacts your portfolio:**  
Helps reduce overall risk through diversification and can offer unique growth opportunities not tied to the stock or bond market.

**Examples:**  
- Real Estate 
- Commodities  
- Private Equity

    ### üìà Variable Income ({variable_income}%)

    Higher risk, focused on long-term growth.  
    **Recommendation:** Start with [S&P 500 index funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp), which offer diversification and are considered a safer bet for beginners.

    ---

    ### üè¶ Fixed Income ({fixed_income}%)

    Lower risk, providing steady returns.  
    **Recommendation:** Consider Treasury Bonds. They are among the safest investments.

    ---

    ### üåé Alternatives ({alternatives}%)

    Diversify your portfolio with assets that don't move like stocks or bonds.  
    **Recommendation:** Look into **data center real estate**, which is in high demand due to the AI boom.
