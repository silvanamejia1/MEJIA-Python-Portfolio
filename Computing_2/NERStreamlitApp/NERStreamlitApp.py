Welcome to the **Custom NER Explorer**!

This app lets you explore how Named Entity Recognition (NER) works using **spaCy**. You can:
- Paste or upload your own text
- Define your own custom entity labels and patterns
- See your custom entities highlighted in the text using DisplaCy

I‚Äôm passionate about the intersection between people and the financial industry, which is what led me to explore wealth management as a career path. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve had the chance to intern in Barcelona and study abroad in London, two experiences that pushed me outside my comfort zone and taught me how to adapt quickly, work across cultures, and communicate clearly. I‚Äôm also actively involved in ALPFA, where I‚Äôve found a community that motivates me to grow both professionally and personally. During my free time, I've become very passionate about Golf, Travel and learning to cook new dishes.")

- Label: FRUIT
- Pattern: apple
