# MEJIA-Python-Portfolio

Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository will include some of the code and projects that I will be working on during my **Elements of Computing II** class, as well as other projects that I work on as I pursue my degree in **Business Analytics** and **Computing**. My goal is to document and showcase my skills in Python through various coding challenges, data analysis tasks, and machine learning projects.
